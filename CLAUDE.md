## Project Overview

HyperDiver is a custom firmware project for the Lorex LHA2104 DVR. The workflow centers on extracting the stock firmware blob, applying `quilt` patches to the extracted rootfs, and repackaging.

## Workflow Commands

All tasks are run via `mise`:

```sh
mise run extract          # Extract firmware.bin → build/rootfs/ (unsquashfs Squashfs_rootfs_1)
mise run set_patchset     # Set the active patchset (QUILT_PATCHSET env var)
mise run load             # Apply all patches (quilt push -a)
mise run new <name>       # Create a new patch file in the active patchset
mise run seal             # Refresh and pop all patches (quilt pop -a); reverts rootfs to stock
```

Quilt patch management requires `QUILT_PATCHSET` to be set before running `new`, `load`, or `seal`. The patchset name corresponds to a subdirectory under `sys/patches/`.

## Architecture

**Firmware layout** (`tooling/parts.py`): The stock `firmware.bin` is a flat binary containing two CRC tables, a uImage header, a Linux 3.10 ARM kernel (zImage + LZMA), and three Squashfs 4.0 (xz-compressed) root filesystems. Extraction targets `Squashfs_rootfs_1` (offset `0x293C1C`) as the primary rootfs.

**Patch system** (`sys/patches/`): Patches are managed with `quilt`. The `series` file controls apply order: `telnet.patch` → `pwd.patch` → `set_system_info.patch` → `entware.patch`. Patches live in `sys/patches/` and are applied against the extracted rootfs.

**Runtime scripts** (`sys/util/`): Shell scripts intended to run on the device itself. `alterna.sh` handles first-boot Entware setup — it bind-mounts `/log/0/hd/opt` over `/opt` for persistence across reboots, then installs Entware (armv7sf-k3.2) on first boot.

**Tooling** (`tooling/`): Python (run via `uv`) handles firmware parsing. `parts.py` defines `FirmwarePart` offsets for the 2104 firmware; `extract.py` slices and writes each part to `build/`.

**Build output**: Extracted parts land in `build/rootfs/`. The `rootfs/mkimg.rootfs` script (from stock tooling) can repackage a rootfs directory into jffs2, cramfs, or yaffs2 images using standard mtd tools.
